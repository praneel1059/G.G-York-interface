# G.G York – Campus Reuse Interface ♻️  
**Human–Computer Interaction Group Project | University of York (2024–2025)**  

G.G York (Go Green York) is a user-centred interface prototype designed to help University of York students **advertise, exchange, and donate reusable items** within their campus community.  
This project was completed as part of the **Human–Computer Interaction (HCIN)** module and demonstrates the full **design thinking process** — from research and persona development to prototyping and evaluation.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview
Many students face challenges reselling or donating unwanted items at the end of term.  
Existing solutions (e.g., Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp) are unstructured, unreliable, and not built for student-specific needs.  
**G.G York** provides a safe, accessible, and intuitive interface for sustainable item reuse across colleges.

---

## 🧠 Design Process
The project followed the **Scenario-Based Design** framework and Nielsen’s + Norman’s design principles.

| Stage | Activities | Outcome |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **User Research** | Conducted 7 interviews, developed personas (*Dorothy* & *Terry*) | Identified key user motivations and pain points |
| **Scenario Development** | Created *As-Is* and *To-Be* scenarios with claims analysis | Defined current frustrations and design opportunities |
| **Prototyping** | Built low-fidelity wireframes in Figma | Designed key functions — Search, Review, Publish, Chat |
| **Evaluation** | Performed Collaborative Heuristic Evaluation (CHE) | Improved usability, consistency, and affordance |
| **Redesign** | Refined icons, filters, and visual hierarchy | Delivered clearer user flow and accessibility improvements |

## 💡 Key Features
- 🔍 **Search & Filter:** Locate items by type, price, or trade status  
- 🗣 **Chat Interface:** Secure, contextual messaging between buyer & seller  
- ⭐ **Review System:** Builds trust through ratings and feedback  
- 📍 **Collection Options:** Choose post-room or self-collection locations  
- 💳 **Payment Flow:** Simulated checkout with PayPal / Apple Pay / Card options  
- 👤 **User Profile:** Displays rating, bio, and listing history  

---

## 🧩 Design Principles Applied
- **Nielsen’s Heuristics** – visibility, consistency, error prevention  
- **Norman’s Principles** – mapping, feedback, affordance  
- **Accessibility & Inclusivity** – clear contrast, concise text, intuitive icons  

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Summary
A Collaborative Heuristic Evaluation identified:
- Inconsistent filter behaviour → redesigned for clarity  
- Poor icon affordance → replaced with labelled buttons  
- Limited visibility of user reviews → integrated on product page  

The redesign increased **learnability** and **user confidence**.
