    <h1>G.G (Go Green) York</h1>
  <p><strong>Human-Computer Interaction Group Project</strong><br>University of York (2024–2025)</p>

  <p>This project was designed to help students exchange and donate reusable items through a user-centered interface, developed as part of the HCIN module.</p>

<h2>Interface Screens</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="images/gg1.png" width="300" alt="Main feed interface">
  <figcaption><b>Main Feed:</b> Displays products in randomized order. Users can swipe right to express interest or left to dismiss, providing a fast and intuitive experience similar to Tinder-style interaction.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="images/gg2.png" width="300" alt="Product search and filters">
  <figcaption><b>Search and Filter:</b> Allows users to search for specific items and apply filters such as price, seller rating, or tradeable status to refine results.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="images/gg3.png" width="300" alt="Product details view">
  <figcaption><b>Product Details:</b> Displays product-specific information like price, seller name, and condition, helping users make informed decisions before purchasing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="images/gg4.png" width="300" alt="Publish item interface">
  <figcaption><b>Publish Item:</b> Enables users to upload images, set a selling or trading option, add pricing, and write descriptions for their items.</figcaption>
</figure>

  <p><em>Note: The following two screens represent early iterations of the prototype, included to show how the design evolved during the feedback process.</em></p>

  <h2>Reflection & Strengths</h2>
  <p>Working on the Human–Computer Interaction group project helped me discover how I approach challenges, learn new tools, and collaborate with others. 
  It pushed me to grow not only as a designer but also as a teammate, and these experiences have shaped how I think about design development today.</p>

  <div class="reflection-card">
    <h3>Innovative Thinker</h3>
    <p>During the project, I aimed to design an app that was both distinctive and easy to use. 
    I introduced features such as a scroll-based product feed and a simple traffic-light system (red, yellow, green) to show the status of product requests. 
    These ideas made the interface feel more intuitive and helped users navigate the app with clarity and ease.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection-card">
    <h3>Agile Learner</h3>
   <p>As the lead designer, I had to learn Figma from scratch — it was completely new to me. 
I taught myself through online tutorials and a lot of trial and error, which really tested my patience but also showed me how much I enjoy learning by doing. 
What kept me going was the shared goal of bringing our team’s vision to life, and seeing the final prototype come together exactly as we imagined was incredibly rewarding.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="reflection-card">
    <h3>Relationship Builder</h3>
<p>Collaboration was at the heart of our project. 
When a teammate mentioned that a few elements were missing just before the deadline, I made sure to listen and understand their perspective rather than react defensively. 
We discussed it, filled in the gaps, and refined the design together. 
Beyond the work itself, I tried to connect with my teammates on a personal level — learning about their interests and ideas helped build trust and make collaboration feel more natural. 
That experience reminded me of the value of empathy and openness when working as a team, especially under pressure.</p>
  </div>

  <p style="text-align:center; margin-top: 25px;"><em>Overall, this project taught me how creativity, adaptability, and collaboration come together to create meaningful, user-centered design.</em></p>
